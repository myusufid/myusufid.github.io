    <h1>Mago: The Blazing Fast Rust-Powered PHP Toolchain</h1>
    <div class="meta mb-4">2026-02-05</div>

    <p>PHP developers have long relied on a suite of excellent tools like PHPStan, Psalm, and PHP-CS-Fixer. These tools
        are indispensable for maintaining code quality, but as projects grow, so does the execution time. Waiting
        minutes for CI pipelines to finish or local checks to run can kill momentum.</p>

    <p>Enter <strong>Mago</strong>, the "Oxidized PHP Toolchain." Written in Rust, Mago promises to be a game-changer
        with blazing fast performance—up to 90x faster than traditional PHP tooling.</p>

    <h2>What is Mago?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://mago.carthage.software/" target="_blank">Mago</a> is a comprehensive toolchain for PHP that aims
        to analyze your entire codebase in seconds, not minutes. It combines several critical development tools into a
        single, high-performance package:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Static Analyzer:</strong> Catches type errors, null pointer exceptions, and logic bugs before they
            hit production.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Formatter:</strong> Automatically enforces PER-CS formatting standards, effectively ending
            style debates.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Linter:</strong> Identifies code smells, security issues, and anti-patterns with over 100+
            built-in rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Rust?</h2>
    <p>By leveraging Rust, Mago achieves performance levels that are simply not possible with tools written in PHP
        itself. While PHP 8.x is fast, Rust's memory safety and zero-cost abstractions make it the perfect candidate for
        building high-throughput developer tooling. This means you can run full project analysis on every save without
        noticing a slowdown.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>Installing Mago is incredibly simple. For macOS, Linux, or WSL, you can use the curl installer:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-bash">curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://carthage.software/mago.sh | bash</code></pre>

    <p>Alternatively, you can install it via Composer, Homebrew, or Cargo:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-bash"># via Composer
composer require --dev carthage/mago

# via Homebrew
brew install carthage-software/tap/mago

# via Cargo
cargo install mago</code></pre>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Once installed, using Mago is straightforward. Initialize it in your project to let it auto-detect your setup:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-bash">mago init</code></pre>

    <p>Then, you have access to its three main commands:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-bash"># Analyze your code
mago check

# Lint your code
mago lint

# Format your code
mago fmt</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Mago represents the next generation of PHP tooling. As the ecosystem matures, having tools that prioritize
        performance will be crucial for maintaining developer velocity in large codebases. If you're tired of waiting
        for your current static analyzer or linter, give Mago a try and experience the speed for yourself.</p>
