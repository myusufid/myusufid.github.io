        <p>Composer, the indispensable PHP dependency management tool, empowers developers in numerous ways:</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Streamlined Dependency Management:</strong> Composer simplifies the process of managing dependencies using packages. With its intuitive interface, you can effortlessly handle your project's external code libraries.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Autoloading, Tailored to You:</strong> Composer supports both PSR-standard and custom file-based autoloading. This flexibility ensures that your application loads classes efficiently, enhancing overall performance.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Optimization for Speed:</strong> Composer goes the extra mile by optimizing your code, resulting in faster execution. By utilizing compiler optimization techniques, it significantly boosts your application's performance.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Lifecycle Event Hooks:</strong> Composer is not just a tool; it's a partner throughout your application's lifecycle. It offers custom hooks into key events, like installation, updates, or initial creation.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Stability Assurance:</strong> Composer provides stability checks, ensuring that your project stays robust and dependable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Composer Install vs. Composer Update</h2>
        
        <h3>Composer Update</h3>
        <p>This command accomplishes two vital tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Updates all required packages to their latest compatible versions</li>
            <li>Updates the composer.lock file with precise version information</li>
        </ul>

        <pre><code lang="bash">composer update</code></pre>

        <h3>Composer Install</h3>
        <p>Focuses on installing dependencies specified in the composer.lock file:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses exact versions from composer.lock</li>
            <li>Creates composer.lock if it doesn't exist</li>
            <li>Ensures consistency across environments</li>
        </ul>

        <pre><code lang="bash">composer install</code></pre>

        <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Use composer update only in development environment, never in production.
        </div>

        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Always commit composer.lock to version control</li>
            <li>Use composer install in production environments</li>
            <li>Regularly update dependencies in development</li>
            <li>Review changes before updating in production</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Commands</h2>
        <pre><code lang="bash"># Initialize a new project
composer init

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Update dependencies
composer update

# Add a new package
composer require vendor/package

# Remove a package
composer remove vendor/package</code></pre>
