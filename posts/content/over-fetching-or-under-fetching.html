        <h2>Over-fetching</h2>
        <p>Over-fetching occurs when you retrieve more data than needed in an API response. This means you're getting data fields that won't be used in your application.</p>

        <h2>Under-fetching</h2>
        <p>Under-fetching happens when a single API endpoint doesn't provide enough data, requiring additional API calls to get all needed information.</p>
