    <h1>My Chaotic Film Diary: Where I Rate Movies Like My Life Depends On It üçø</h1>
    <div class="meta mb-4">April 15, 2025 ‚Ä¢ A confession of my questionable taste in entertainment</div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Welcome to my digital diary of cinematic adventures, where I've somehow convinced myself that my opinion on movies matters enough to put it on the internet. Spoiler alert: it probably doesn't, but here we are anyway! üé¨</p>

        <p>Fair warning: I'm the person who cried during WALL-E (yes, at a robot love story), gave PARASITE a perfect 10 while also rating EXIT a 10 (don't @ me), and somehow managed to watch enough Korean content to single-handedly boost their tourism industry. My rating system is based on the highly scientific method of "how much did this make me feel things" combined with "would I watch this again instead of doing actual work?"</p>

        <h2>üé≠ Films (AKA My Emotional Rollercoaster Collection)</h2>
        <p>Here's where I pretend to be a sophisticated film critic while secretly ranking movies based on how much popcorn I consumed during each one:</p>
        
        <ul class="film-list">

        </ul>

        <h2>üèÜ My Top Picks (AKA The "Made Me Question My Life Choices" Collection)</h2>
        <p>The chosen ones that received the coveted 10/10 rating from someone whose qualifications include "watches too much Netflix":</p>
        
        <ul class="top-picks">
            <li><strong>MR ROBOT</strong> - For making me paranoid about technology while being addicted to it</li>
            <li><strong>A VISIT LONG</strong> - For emotional devastation I'm still recovering from</li>
            <li><strong>YOU ARE THE APPLE OF MY EYE</strong> - For ruining my realistic expectations about romance</li>
            <li><strong>FILOSOFI KOPI</strong> - For making me insufferable about coffee culture</li>
            <li><strong>1 LITRE OF TEARS</strong> - For providing exactly what the title promised</li>
            <li><strong>MIRACLE IN CELL NO.7</strong> - For proving that Korean cinema owns my emotional well-being</li>
            <li><strong>PARASITE</strong> - For being objectively perfect and making me feel smart for recognizing it</li>
            <li><strong>EXIT</strong> - For being ridiculously entertaining and I will die on this hill</li>
            <li><strong>REPLY 1988</strong> - For making me nostalgic for a decade I didn't even live through</li>
            <li><strong>LIVE</strong> - For being the police procedural I never knew I needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ü§î Some Questionable Life Choices (AKA My Rating Philosophy)</h2>
        <p>You might notice some... interesting patterns in my ratings. Let me explain my highly scientific methodology:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>10/10:</strong> Made me feel things I didn't know I could feel</li>
            <li><strong>9/10:</strong> Excellent but didn't completely destroy my emotional stability</li>
            <li><strong>8/10:</strong> Really good and I'd recommend it to friends</li>
            <li><strong>7/10:</strong> Decent entertainment, no regrets</li>
            <li><strong>6/10:</strong> Meh, but I finished it so that counts for something</li>
            <li><strong>5/10:</strong> Why did I do this to myself?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Yes, I gave EXIT the same rating as PARASITE. No, I will not be taking questions at this time. Sometimes a movie about a guy escaping toxic gas through parkour hits exactly the same emotional notes as a Palme d'Or winner, and that's just science. üß™</p>

        <h2>üìä Fun Stats About My Questionable Taste</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most cried during:</strong> 1 LITRE OF TEARS (the title wasn't lying)</li>
            <li><strong>Most rewatched:</strong> REPLY 1988 (comfort food for the soul)</li>
            <li><strong>Biggest plot twist:</strong> Realizing I have a type (emotional devastation)</li>
            <li><strong>Most controversial rating:</strong> SE7EN at 6/10 (come at me, film bros)</li>
            <li><strong>Gateway drug to K-dramas:</strong> GOBLIN (and now look at me)</li>
            <li><strong>Made me hungriest:</strong> EXTREME JOB (fried chicken cravings for weeks)</li>
            <li><strong>Most confusing rating I gave myself:</strong> EXIT 10/10 (but I stand by it)</li>
            <li><strong>Shortest attention span test:</strong> Any movie over 2.5 hours (sorry, epics)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üé¨ What This List Says About Me (A Self-Roast)</h2>
        <p>Looking at this collection, it's clear that I:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have an unhealthy relationship with Korean media (no regrets)</li>
            <li>Cry at movies more than a reasonable adult should</li>
            <li>Rate things based on emotional damage rather than technical merit</li>
            <li>Somehow convinced myself that EXIT deserves the same rating as PARASITE</li>
            <li>Have watched enough Asian cinema to qualify for a cultural studies degree</li>
            <li>Probably need therapy (but movies are cheaper)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üçø The "What Should You Watch?" Totally Unsolicited Advice Section</h2>
        
        <h3>If You Want to Cry:</h3>
        <p>Start with 1 LITRE OF TEARS, move to MIRACLE IN CELL NO.7, finish with A VISIT LONG. Bring tissues. Bring backup tissues. Call in sick tomorrow.</p>

        <h3>If You Want to Laugh:</h3>
        <p>EXIT for pure fun, EXTREME JOB for food cravings, SPEEDY SCANDAL for wholesome giggles. Your abs will thank you.</p>

        <h3>If You Want to Question Everything:</h3>
        <p>MR ROBOT for existential tech crisis, PARASITE for social commentary, JOKER for... well, chaos.</p>

        <h3>If You Want to Fall in Love with Love:</h3>
        <p>YOU ARE THE APPLE OF MY EYE, then CRASH LANDING ON YOU, followed by immediate disappointment in real-life romance.</p>

        <h3>If You Want to Be Scared (But Not Too Scared):</h3>
        <p>THE UNINVITED, ROH, or PENGABDI SETAN. Perfect for people who like horror but also like sleeping at night.</p>

        <h2>üé≠ My Rating Scale Explained (Because Apparently I Need to Justify My Choices)</h2>
        <p>Since people keep asking about my "unique" rating system, here's the breakdown:</p>

        <h2>ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Frequently Asked Questions (That Nobody Actually Asked)</h2>
        
        <h3>Q: Why did you give EXIT a 10/10?</h3>
        <p>A: Because sometimes you need a movie about a guy doing parkour to escape toxic gas, and EXIT delivered that experience flawlessly. Art is subjective, Karen.</p>

        <h3>Q: How can you rate SE7EN only 6/10?</h3>
        <p>A: Look, I get that it's a "masterpiece," but it just didn't hit for me. Sometimes the emperor has no clothes, sometimes SE7EN is just okay. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

        <h3>Q: Are you okay? You seem to cry at a lot of movies.</h3>
        <p>A: I'm perfectly fine, thank you. I just have a healthy relationship with my emotions and an unhealthy relationship with Korean cinema.</p>

        <h3>Q: Why so many Korean movies and dramas?</h3>
        <p>A: Because Korean entertainment industry said "let's make this person emotionally dependent on our content" and succeeded spectacularly.</p>

        <h3>Q: What's your favorite genre?</h3>
        <p>A: Emotional devastation with a side of cultural education, apparently.</p>

        <h2>üéØ What's Next on My Watchlist (AKA Future Emotional Damage)</h2>
        <p>Currently queued up for my next round of questionable life choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More Korean dramas (obviously)</li>
            <li>That Thai movie everyone's talking about</li>
            <li>Some Indonesian horror that will probably make me sleep with lights on</li>
            <li>Whatever Netflix algorithm thinks will destroy me emotionally</li>
            <li>Probably rewatching REPLY 1988 for the 47th time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üìù Final Thoughts (AKA My Manifesto on Entertainment)</h2>
        <p>Look, I know my taste in movies and shows might seem all over the place. I give perfect scores to both arthouse films and action comedies. I cry at robot love stories and rate serious thrillers lower than parkour escape movies. But here's the thing:</p>

        <p>Entertainment is personal. What moves you, makes you laugh, makes you think, or makes you feel‚Äîthat's what matters. Not what critics say, not what's "objectively good," not what wins awards (though sometimes they align, looking at you PARASITE).</p>

        <p>My 10/10s aren't just about technical excellence‚Äîthey're about movies and shows that made me feel alive, that stuck with me long after the credits rolled, that made me want to immediately text someone and say "YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS RIGHT NOW."</p>

        <p>So yeah, I stand by every rating on this list, even the controversial ones. Especially the controversial ones. Life's too short to pretend you don't like things just because they're not "sophisticated" enough.</p>

        <p>Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date with my couch, some popcorn, and whatever Korean drama is about to emotionally wreck me next. üçø‚ú®</p>

        <h2>üîó Where to Find These Gems</h2>
        <p>Most of these are scattered across various streaming platforms like Netflix, Viu, Disney+, and some... other places we don't talk about in polite company. Happy hunting!</p>

        <p><em>Disclaimer: This list is a living document of my questionable taste and will be updated as I continue to make poor life choices in the name of entertainment. No refunds on emotional damage caused by following my recommendations.</em></p>
